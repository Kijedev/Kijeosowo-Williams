                I collaborated with a Senior Developer to build Imo Talent Hub,
                a React.js web application for the Imo State Government that
                serves over 100,000 users seeking tech skills, and also
                contributed to the development of the FindExperts web
                application using React.js. I worked on the Eye on Imo website,
                an investment performance platform that helps the citizens of
                Imo State make informed investment decisions. In addition, I
                managed and updated all Techsoma Blog websites (techsoma.me,
                techsoma.africa, techsoma.ca) with WordPress, which drove a 15%
                increase in monthly traffic through consistent updates and
                optimizations. I designed and developed the FindBlack Experts
                website with WordPress and Elementor, creating a fully
                responsive and SEO-friendly platform that improved search
                rankings, and also built a custom WordPress template from
                scratch for the redesigned Techsoma websites, enhancing site
                speed by 25% while delivering a cohesive brand experience.
                Furthermore, I maintained and optimized a clientâ€™s WordPress
                e-commerce store (Afromaya), resulting in an 8% improvement in
                page load time and higher sales conversions.

                efficiency. I designed a responsive UI using React.js and
                Tailwind CSS, boosting mobile engagement, and optimized
                performance to reduce page load time by 15%, driving an increase
                in inorganic traffic. I also built reusable and scalable
                components following solid design principles, cutting down
                future development time, and ensured cross-browser and
                cross-device compatibility, which reduced UI-related support
                tickets. Additionally, I executed over 50 unit and integration
                tests, resolving 90% of bugs pre-launch and ensuring a smooth,
                stable production rollout.

                I helped develop a secure Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system
                used by 100+ healthcare professionals across 20+ clinics,
                improving patient data access and workflow efficiency. I built a
                compliant and accessible UI in React.js that streamlined doctor
                workflows and reduced form errors, while applying performance
                best practices that cut page load times by half. I also
                delivered interactive features such as patient search and record
                filters, boosting task efficiency by 50%. To ensure reliability,
                I conducted cross-browser testing and resolved UI/UX
                inconsistencies. Working closely with cross-functional teams, we
                launched the system ahead of schedule and fully met client
                requirements.
