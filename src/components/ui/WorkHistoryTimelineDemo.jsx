I designed and implemented major product interfaces including the homepage, teacher dashboard, student dashboard, and AI tools using React.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and collaborated with backend engineers to integrate RESTful APIs for classroom operations such as automated pre test generation and progress tracking. I rebuilt the tools page architecture to improve scalability and UI and UX, cutting load time by 50 percent and boosting user efficiency, and partnered with designers to convert Figma prototypes into pixel perfect, reusable React components with responsive layouts and accessibility in mind. I also optimized frontend performance with efficient state management, code splitting, and lazy loading, reducing page load times by 30 percent. Throughout the project I participated in agile sprint planning, code reviews, and testing to maintain product quality and ensure timely delivery. The upgraded platform was delivered ahead of schedule, supporting a strong internal demo and beta rollout, and the work leveraged React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Axios, and Git and GitHub.",

In addition, I managed and updated all Techsoma Blog websites (techsoma.me, techsoma.africa, techsoma.ca) with WordPress, which drove a 15% increase in monthly traffic through consistent updates and optimizations. I designed and developed the FindBlack Experts website with WordPress and Elementor, creating a fully responsive and SEO-friendly platform that improved search rankings, and also built a custom WordPress template from scratch for the redesigned Techsoma websites, enhancing site speed by 25% while delivering a cohesive brand experience.
